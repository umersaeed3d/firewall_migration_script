# firewall_migration_script
A firewall configuration migration script in beta version that targets the CISCO to JUNIPER or vise versa.

Though, this script is not much practical for every configuration file. However, I have written this script to challenge my conversion skills with MongoDB
I will add User Interface soon in this script.

# Steps:
- git clone https://github.com/umersaeed3d/firewall_migration_script/
- Edit the .env file
- Cisco and Juniper demo configuration files are already in the project within configuration_files directory
- npm run start
